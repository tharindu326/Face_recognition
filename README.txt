Note: This is to veryfy that the provided code is and the API (flask_server_v1.py) is
      working perfectly as i shown in demo video. 
      
      Please watch the video_demo i have clearly mention everything on it!!!!!!!!

1. install python 3 (Better you can use Phycharm IDE)

2. Install all the requirements (libraries) in the requirements.txt and 
   requirements_dev.txtv (in pycharm all requirements will be auto downloaded)

3. Open flask_server_v1.py and run it 
     
     OUTPUT give as follow if the code work correctly;
            
        "C:\Program Files\Python37\python.exe" G:/Zeynoc/Zeynoc5r/Prakas24/face_recog_prakas/flask_server_v1.py
        * Serving Flask app "flask_server_v1" (lazy loading)
        * Environment: production
          WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
          Use a production WSGI server instead.
        * Debug mode: on
        * Restarting with stat
        * Debugger is active!
        * Debugger PIN: 704-640-504
        * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

4. Then open your browser and go to the URL http://localhost:5000/face_rec 
   then you will get the login page. 


Notes: 
 
      Add the regidtered students (users ho will have the access) to sample_images folder 

      Make sure that all the files (flask_server_v1.py / face_util.py / sample_images / 
      face_recognition) are together in a same directory.

      Before you run this on your wensite your website developer will have to deploy 
      the API on a Server. NOt localhost! 

      If you want to change the format of login page i have created for 
      demonstration, you only have to change the java scripts and HTML in 
      flask_server_v1.py from line 45 to 190
